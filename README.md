#### Steps to recreate
  - Create a comment as a regular user.
  - This comment is then accepted by the admin.
  - Using the same information as the first comment, add the following line of code in the `comment` form:
    
    `<a title='x onmouseover=alert(unescape(/hello%20world/.source)) style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;height:5000px  AAAAAAAAAAAA...[64 kb]..AAA'></a>`
- Since once the given credential has been accepted to give comment, the next comment does not need to be approved by the administrator any longer.
- When the admin logged themself into WP and click on the comment section of the post where the XSS script is located, the script will be executed. 
- An alert window will pop up with the message `hello world`
